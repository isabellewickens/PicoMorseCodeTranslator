## 📜 Overview  
Developed an interactive Morse code recognition system using a Raspberry Pi Pico as part of a team of three. Implemented button input handling to detect Morse code sequences, with real-time validation and visual feedback via RGB LEDs (green for correct input, red for incorrect). Integrated a 7-segment display to output decoded letters and used a potentiometer to dynamically adjust timing thresholds, allowing user-controlled difficulty.
